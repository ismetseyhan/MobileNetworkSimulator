# MobileNetworkSimulator
Nowadays, almost all of us carry mobile devices that
communicate to each other in a direct or indirect way.
Mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a decentralized
network which comprises of a collection of these devices/nodes
that interact with each other, forming a
temporary network without any aid of a centralized
administration. Since the advent of it, MANETs are
now integral components of many applications such
as military applications, virtual conferences, and disaster
recovery operations; they have become part of
out daily lives.
The topology of a MANET is dynamic as the nodes
belonging to MANET can enter or leave constantly.
Devices, we call them as nodes henceforth, must route
the packets to another in order to make the network
fully connected. Two chosen nodes are said to be ‘directly connected’ to each other as long
as they are located somewhere within the transmission ranges of each other so they can
communicate directly; otherwise they would require other nodes to communicate. Hence, a
route should be established first for the message delivery between two nodes.
Routing –a process of moving a packet of data from source to destination– in such dynamic,
infrastructure-less mobile ad-hoc network has always been an attractive research area for
scientists, it is known as routing in MANET in the literature. The quality of a route
between sender and receiver nodes varies depending on the network or the problem type at
hand.
In the following section, approaches for network and route construction as well as optimal
route selection are described in detail.
